There was "no doubt" that Yushchenko's disease "has been caused by a case of poisoning by dioxin," Dr. Michael Zimpfer, president of the Rudolfinerhaus Hospital said at a news conference on Saturday.
"We do not and have not supported any particular candidate in Ukraine's presidential election," he said. "
The United States on Monday urged the Ukrainian government to fully investigate the "terrible" poisoning of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko with the highly toxic substance dioxin.
There were high concentrations of dioxin, most likely orally administered," said Zimpfer, director of the Vienna Rudolfinerhaus hospital, where Yushchenko has been receiving treatment."
