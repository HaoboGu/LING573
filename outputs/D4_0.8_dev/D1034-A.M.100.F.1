The survey found that 32 percent of amphibian species face extinction, compared to 12 percent of bird species and 23 percent of mammal species.
"Amphibians are one of nature's best indicators of overall environmental health," said Russell A. Mittermeier, president of Conservation International. "
They're good red flags for us to watch."
Scientists suspect a variety of factors, including the spread of a deadly fungus that may have originated in Africa, global climate change, or a combination.
Of the 5,743 known species of toads, frogs, salamanders, newts and worm like amphibians, 1,856 (32.5 percent) are under threat, according to the work by 500 researchers in 60 countries.
