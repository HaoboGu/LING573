HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The bird flu in Hong Kong, which has killed two people, has not become an epidemic, a local senior health official said today.
The inter-department Special Working Group was set up yesterday to coordinate efforts toward the prevention and control of the spread of the mysterious bird flu after three more people were suspected last week of having been infected with the H5NI virus, bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases to seven.
A 5-year-old child died in May in the first known case of a human contracting the virus.
Of the nine confirmed cases, a three-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a 54-year-old man have died.
