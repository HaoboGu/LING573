The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible items such as petrol and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli powder used by the British company Premium Foods to make Worcester sauce, which was then added as an ingredient in a wide range of products.
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has launched an unprecedented probe into how a potentially cancer-causing dye contaminated at least 474 products, ranging from ready-made meals to popular sauces, that have been withdrawn from sale.
Sudan I is banned from food in Britain and across the European Union, and since 2003 all chili powder imported to Britain must be certified to be free of Sudan I.
