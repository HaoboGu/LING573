He is a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee.
A Samsung executive was accused of donating illicit funds to political parties while dozens of lawmakers, politicians and aides to Roh were arrested.
The recordings reportedly contain discussions about a proposal to give three billion won (2.9 million dollars) to the then-ruling party chief Lee Hoi-Chang.
South Korea was rattled by widespread corruption scandals last year after prosecutors launched a probe into illegal donations by businesses to politicians during the presidential poll in 2002.
The suicide attempt came after Roh asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to investigate the case.
