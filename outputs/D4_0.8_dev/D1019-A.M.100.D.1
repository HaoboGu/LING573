KUALA LUMPUR, April 24 (Xinhua) -- About 20 people, including foreign tourists, were taken hostage by armed pirates on Sipadan island off the Sabah coast, East Malaysia, Sunday night, according to police sources Monday.
"I don't want to do anything that would endanger their lives," he said.
Muslim rebels in the Philippines who are seeking the release of militants jailed in the World Trade Center bombing case claimed responsibility Tuesday for the Malaysian kidnapping.
The hostages forced onto the fishing boats included two French tourists, three Germans, two South Africans, two Finns and one Lebanese, as well as a Filipino worker and nine Malaysians, authorities said.
