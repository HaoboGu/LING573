The destination is Medan, capital of North Sumatra, Indonesia, according to the China Southern Airlines that operates the cargo flight.
The two batches of relief goods, worth 21.63 million yuan (2.62 million US dollars), are mainly tents, blankets, sheets and food that are badly needed by the people affected by the tsunami.
The killer tsunami that was touched off by an 8.7-magnitude earthquake off Indonesia's Sumatra island on Dec. 26, has climbed to over 145,000 so far, with over 90,000 deaths reported in Indonesia.
Bangladesh would airlift and ship 1, 000 metric tons of high energy biscuits (HEB) for the tsunami victims of Indonesia and Sri Lanka this week.
