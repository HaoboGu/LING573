LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Students returned to classes Thursday at Chatfield High School, but the bloodbath at rival Columbine High haunted the halls.
"We have friends whose children go to Columbine," Mrs. Hoag said. "
She said the school was allowing students to stay home.
Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, also Columbine students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs.
Instead, we've all come together," said Phyllis Cain, whose daughter, Mickey, attends Columbine. "
"It's just good to be smiling and laughing," he said.
