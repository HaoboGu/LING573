Many immediately drew parallels between the murder of Van Gogh, was shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam street, and the assassination of outspoken politician Pim Fortuyn on May 6, 2002.
Dutch Queen Beatrix and Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende voiced shock and concern at van Gogh's assassination soon after the killing.
His alleged assailant, identified as having dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality, was arrested shortly after the attack.
Van Gogh, 47, was widely known for his outspoken criticism of Islam and recently caused uproar with a short film linking domestic abuse with the perceived subservient position of women in the Islamic faith.
