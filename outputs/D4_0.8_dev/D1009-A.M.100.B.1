BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Prosecutors received nearly $80,000 Thursday to help finance the grand jury investigation into the JonBenet Ramsey slaying through March.
Police say her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, remain under suspicion.
The toy was reportedly among stuffed animals found in JonBenet's room.
The Ramsey interviews arrive as Boulder, Colo., District Attorney Alex Hunter decides whether to take the case to a grand jury.
JonBenet was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996 in her home in Boulder, Colorado.
The friend, Fleet White, criticized the Ramseys, saying their refusal to cooperate with detectives hurt the investigation of their daughter's death.
