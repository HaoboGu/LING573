About 1,800 cases of food poisoning caused by listeria are reported in the United States each year.
Most at risk are pregnant women, the elderly and people with weak immune systems.
A recall of meats made by a Sara Lee Corp. subsidiary, Bil Mar Foods in Zeeland, Mich., began on Dec. 22.
"Listeria is rare," said Dr. Robert Tauxe, chief of the food-borne and diarrheal diseases branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, "but in someone susceptible, it is catastrophic."
Over the weekend, it announced the recall of hot dogs from Thorn Apple Valley in Forrest City, Ark., because of listeria.
