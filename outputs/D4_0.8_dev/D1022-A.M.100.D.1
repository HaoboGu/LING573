Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with a 1986 IWC moratorium.
The next year it resumed catches under a loophole that allows "research whaling," despite international protests.
Prime Minister John Howard intervened personally, writing to his Japanese counterpart Junichiro Koizumi at the weekend to urge Tokyo to reconsider its position on whaling, Environment Minister Ian Campbell said.
Tokyo has applied to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) for permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.
