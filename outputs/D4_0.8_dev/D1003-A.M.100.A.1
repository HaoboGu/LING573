The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species, with an estimated 1,000 living in the mountainous regions of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.
To protect the animal, dubbed China's "national treasure," the country has set up 33 nature reserves, covering a total area of 1.6 million hectares.
Forest coverage in southwestern Sichuan Province has increased to 27.94 percent from 24.3 percent in 2003, making the region, a major habitat of giant pandas, a greener home, according to the local government.
Currently more than 1,500 giant pandas live wild in China, according to a survey by the State Forestry Administration.
