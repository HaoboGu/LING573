Former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in central Beirut on Monday, Lebanese officials and medical sources said.
He came to office first in 1992 and headed five governments over 12 years.
He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
On Monday, Hariri and eight other people were killed in a huge explosion, which occurred as Hariri's motorcade was passing by in the seafront area of the Lebanese capital Beirut.
French President Jacques Chirac was due to arrive in Beirut on Wednesday to present his condolences to the family of Hariri but appeared unlikely to attend the funeral in time.
