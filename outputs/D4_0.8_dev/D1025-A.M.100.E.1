Nonetheless, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list later this year.
"The Yellowstone grizzly is the Endangered Species Act's best recovery story," said Chris Servheen, a University of Montana professor and head of the federal agency's grizzly bear recovery team.
Federal wildlife officials estimate that more than 600 grizzly bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
Stripping the bears of protection could eventually clear the way for hunting of grizzlies in that region.
Other conservation groups, however, including the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, oppose delisting.
