THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd on Saturday whirred away from the Caribbean's Leeward Islands, but forecasters warned that Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could be hit by heavy rains and flooding.
At 5 p.m. Saturday, Floyd was centered about 335 miles northeast of Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan.
A hurricane liaison team of federal emergency officials is also stationed at the National Hurricane Center in Miami to monitor the latest forecasts of the storm's path and intensity.
