Blake is accused of murdering Bakley on May 4, 2001.
Blake, 71, is charged with murder, two counts of solicitation of murder.
_ Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, a former methamphetamine user, said Blake solicited him to kill his wife.
If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
"He said he would do anything to protect that child," Samuels said.
Bakley, 44, was killed May 4, 2001, outside Blake's favorite Italian restaurant in Studio City.
Gary McLarty, a former "Baretta" stuntman and admitted cocaine user, testified that Blake offered him $10,000 (euro7,608) and "insinuated" that he wanted Bakley dead.
