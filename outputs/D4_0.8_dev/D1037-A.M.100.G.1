Federal funding for oyster restoration efforts in Maryland and Virginia exceeded $4 million this year, organizers of Saturday's event said.
"There's no one else," said Karen Oertel, of W.H. Harris Seafood House in Chester, Md. "Nobody shucks an oyster anymore."
The University of Maryland's Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge, Md., is home to research on the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster, Crassostrea virginica,@ and an Asian oyster that some officials want to introduce into the bay.
The pollution, from farms and sewage plants across the bay's 64,000-square-mile watershed, causes algae blooms that suck oxygen from the water.
