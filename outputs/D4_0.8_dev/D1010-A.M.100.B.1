The fatal brain-wasting disease is believed to come from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease.
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, eats holes in the brains of cattle.
It appeared in Britain in 1986 and spread through Europe and Asia, prompting massive destruction of herds and devastating the European beef industry.
Agriculture Department inspectors continue to identify and destroy cattle infected with BSE, including 104 this year.
In the mid 1990s the British government announced a probable link between BSE and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), the human form of mad cow disease, which can cause personality change, loss of body function, and eventually death.
