A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported.
Few people live near the mountain, about 100 miles south of Seattle.
"This is exactly the eruption we predicted," the USGS's
Interior Secretary Gale Norton, who flew over the mountain Saturday, said the seismic activity has weakened the 1,000-foot (300-meter) lava dome that began forming in the volcano's crater after the 1980 eruption.
The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the volcano, which killed 57 people during a major eruption in 1980, was shaken by a "tremor burst" for 25 minutes.
