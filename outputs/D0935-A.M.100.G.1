Still without approval from baseball club owners or the city they plan to call home, the Washington Nationals were born Monday in a sea of red, white and blue.
The new National League Nationals were named not only before they have approval to play in the nation's capital, but also before they have a new owner.
The approval was "subject to all conditions set forth in the Baseball Stadium Agreement," signed by the Expos and Washington Mayor Anthony Williams.
