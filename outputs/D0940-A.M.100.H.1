Commissioner for Tourism Eva  Cheng Wednesday said the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland will be  divided into three phases from early August in order to ensure a  smooth and well-coordinated start.
Disney officials consulted Chinese feng shui experts before building Hong Kong Disneyland, making changes such as tilting the site of the park several degrees and setting up "no fire zones" in kitchens, a company spokeswoman said Sunday.
Tsang's administration says the park will create thousands of new jobs and help turn Hong Kong into a regional tourist destination for families.
