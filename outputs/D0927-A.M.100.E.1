"World News Tonight" anchor Peter Jennings has lung cancer, ABC announced Tuesday, but plans to remain on the job throughout his treatment.
Westin called the news "a tough assignment," while Jennings, 66, said it was "quite a surprise."
Jennings joined ABC News in 1964 and served as the anchor of "ABC Evening News" from 1965 to 1968.
"I will continue to do the broadcast," he said.
