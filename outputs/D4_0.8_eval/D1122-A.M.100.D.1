people were killed in the collapse of a bridge Wednesday in Minneapolis , Minnesota that sent cars and trucks tumbling into the Mississippi River , the mayor said .
Gov . Tim Pawlenty said the bridge was inspected by the Minnesota Department of Transportation in 2005 and 2006 and that no structural problems were noted. ``
It was built with a single steel arch to avoid the need for piers that might interfere with river navigation .
The steel-arched bridge , built in 1967 , rose 64 feet above the river and stretched 1,900 feet across the water .
