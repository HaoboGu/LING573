Blake described himself to Walters as "an old man" and said he had been spending his time picking up women in bars, suggesting that his relationship with Bakley and the birth of the baby was an improvement.
As early as the night of Bakley's murder, Blake ``did some suspicious things'' that led detectives at the scene to focus on him as a possible suspect, Samuels said.
Blake "is a man of emotions," Schwartzbach said.
Blake mentioned that he knew she was doing "her business" from his house and "I was going to take care of that."
