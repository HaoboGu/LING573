The bamboo blooming in the  early 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 giant pandas.
Giant pandas are said to have been around during the time of  dinosaurs and regarded as a "national gem" of China.
Zhang said that the preserve will dispatch frequent patrols and rescue giant pandas in danger of starvation.
The three Beijing giant pandas about to leave were born respectively in 1991, 1999 and 2003, and one of the three Sichuan pandas was also born last year.
More than 1,500 giant pandas live wild in China, with Sichuan  home to 76 percent of them, according to the State Forestry  Administration.
