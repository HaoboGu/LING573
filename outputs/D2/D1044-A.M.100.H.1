The dye, known as Sudan I, is linked to an increased risk of  cancer, but is not thought to be a risk to health at the  concentrations used in these products, said a BBC report.
The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible  items such as petrol and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli  powder used by the British company Premium Foods to make Worcester  Sauce, which was then used as an ingredient in a wide range of  products, the FSA said.
"The vast majority of products contaminated with the illegal dye  Sudan I have been removed from sale," the agency said in a  statement.
