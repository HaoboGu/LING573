Australia's prime minister on Wednesday criticized a move by Japan to increase its whale harvest in the Antarctic as a "very bad decision," but stood by his policy of not intercepting Japanese whaling boats.
Fitzsimons dismissed Japan's scientific whaling as a cover for continuing "to put whale meat on the table in Japan."
Japan has said it will push for a widening of its research whaling program at a meeting of the IWC that began in Ulsan, South Korea last week.
"The submissions of the attorney-general appear to have great  force," Allsop said in his ruling.
