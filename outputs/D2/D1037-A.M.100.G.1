The University of Maryland's Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge, Md., is home to research on the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster, Crassostrea virginica,@ and an Asian oyster that some officials want to introduce into the bay.
The managed reserve method is ``the beginning of a new approach to managing oysters and oyster disease,'' said Goldsborough of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
The laboratory's work with the Asian oyster, Crassostrea ariakensis,@ is part of a larger scientific and political debate.
But over the past three decades, the bay's oysters have been ravaged by pollution and a pair of diseases.
