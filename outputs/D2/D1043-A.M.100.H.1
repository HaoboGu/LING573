Hariri was important as a symbol of Lebanon to the outside world.
Over the years, Hariri became more and more concerned with Syrian influence in Lebanon, a product of Syria's military and intelligence presence left over from the war.
On Monday, Hariri and eight other people were killed in a huge  explosion, which occurred as Hariri's motorcade was passing by in  the seafront area of the Lebanese capital Beirut.
Seven of the coffins were first placed on the ground, and that of Hariri, draped in a red, white and green Lebanese flag, was passed overhead by the mourners.
