The others are eight Malaysians and two Filipino workers, he said, adding that the names of the hostages would be released by the Malaysian police.
He said most of the hostages were Europeans and Americans.
''Our group is behind the abduction of the foreigners (in Malaysia) and there are still a lot of surprises for the government if they won't listen to us,'' Abu Ahmad, spokesman for the Philippine rebel group Abu Sayyaf, said in an interview over local radio station DXRZ.
"The government is doing everything in its power to secure the release of these two people," he said.
