China's State Environmental  Protection Administration (SEPA) said here on Wednesday that the  Songhua River in northeast China suffered a major water pollution  incident owing to the explosion of a petrochemical plant at the  upper reaches.
The front of the polluted water of  Songhua River in northeast China reached Harbin, capital of  Heilongjiang Province, on early Thursday morning, local  environment authority said.
He said Jilin had quickly blocked entry of the pollutants into  the river and discharged water from a reservoir to dilute  pollutants in the river.
The Songhua River  is a tributary of the Heilong River (called Amur River in Russia)  on the border between the Russian far east and China.
