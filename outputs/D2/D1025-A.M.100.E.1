"A lot of the seeds that grizzly bears really like are going to be greatly reduced, and not over decades but in the next 10 years," Schwandt said.
"The Yellowstone grizzly is the Endangered Species Act's best recovery story," said Chris Servheen, a University of Montana professor and head of the federal agency's grizzly bear recovery team.
The law protects the bears in Yellowstone, part of Grand Teton and in a circle of land outside, known as the ``primary recovery area.''
``Sentiment against the bears and the government is the biggest handicap to investigation.''
