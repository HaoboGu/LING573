The scientists say this strength in the face of warming will not be enough to save the world's coral reefs, which are threatened by pollution, overfishing, tourism and other human activities.
"Once again, human impacts are to blame for the depletion of reefs," the union said in a statement, adding that climate change and the encroachment of introduced species such as starfish were also major factors.
The ocean's seagrass bed and mangrove ecosystem would also be affected, Putra said, but it is the reefs that bore the brunt of the destruction.
