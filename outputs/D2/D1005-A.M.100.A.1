The researchers gave rats a toxin that induces Parkinson's and then counted dopamine-producing cells in the brains of rats that had exercised for seven days and those that had not.
Investigators studied five families with a history of Parkinson's disease who lived in the Basque region of Spain and in England.
"Dopamine is a brain chemical associated with feelings of pleasure and reward that is thought to contribute to learning through both positive and negative feedback," said the report.
It is associated with abnormal structures, called Lewy bodies, found in certain areas of the brain, and leads to a slowly progressing neurological degeneration.
