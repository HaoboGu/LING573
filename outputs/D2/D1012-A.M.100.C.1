Most of the passengers and crew were Greek Cypriot, the spokesman said.
Helios airline officials refused to release the passenger list but said 48 of the passengers were "youth travelers" bound for Prague, Czech Republic, after a stopover in Athens.
Greek government spokesman Roussopoulos said the pilots sent  to investigate reported that with the pilots out of action there  may have been a last-gasp effort by two others on the plane to  bring the craft back under control.
