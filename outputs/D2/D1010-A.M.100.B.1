The EU said the program was one of 82 programs tackling 10 major animal diseases, including rabies, mad cow, and scrapie, a similar brain-wasting disease found in sheep.
It is the second case since March in which the disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, has been confirmed in a cow that died rather than having been slaughtered, the ministry said.
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, eats holes in the brains of cattle.
