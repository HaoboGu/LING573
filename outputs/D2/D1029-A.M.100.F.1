Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after eight people  died in a rocket attack on Pakistan's largest gas plant at Sui,  which the tribesmen said was sparked by the rape of a female doctor  at the installation.
Raziq Bugti, spokesman for the provincial government of  Baluchistan, said the exodus was sparked in the town of Dera Bugti,  245 kilometres southeast of Quetta after the chief told officials  and paramilitary forces to leave.
Dera Bugti, some 160 kilometres (99 miles) from the shrine, was  the scene of fierce gunbattles on Thursday between troops and  tribesmen, who are waging a revolt in a bid to win more royalties  from the province's natural resources.
