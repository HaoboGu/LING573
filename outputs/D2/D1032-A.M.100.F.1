Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Monday that it was trying to seal off a gas leak on a platform in the North Sea where production had been suspended and most employees evacuated owing to the risk of an explosion.
"At the moment it is unclear when production from Snorre A and Vigdis will resume," Statoil said in a statement.
Norway's daily oil production was down by an estimated 4 percent after a gas leak forced Statoil ASA to shut down one of its platforms in the North Sea.
