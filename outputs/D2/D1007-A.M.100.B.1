The Department of Health prepared a fact sheet to explain to tourists the avian flu, which is caused by a virus H5N1 that is only found in poultry.
A top Chinese official in charge of animal quarantines confirmed on Thursday that the H5N1 virus has not been found among chickens shipped to Hong Kong and Macao.
A three-year-old boy and a man died earlier this year after catching the "bird flu", or H5N1 strain of influenza, and a 13-year-old girl is in hospital with the disease.
All hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong have been ordered to test patients for the flu.
