A judge heard motions Friday from lawyers for the two brothers, Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, and a Dutch youth, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17 -- the three prime suspects in the case, who were the last people known to have seen Holloway before she disappeared in the wee hours of May 30.
Searches by authorities, volunteer islanders and tourists have led nowhere.
On Friday, a judge ruled on a petition from the elder van der Sloot to visit his son, whom he has not been allowed to see since Joran was detained on June 9, and from the Kalpoes' attorneys requesting to see any evidence prosecutors may have gathered, Croes said.
