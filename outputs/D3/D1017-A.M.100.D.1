Floyd was expected to intensify, and  it was unlikely to hit land soon.
It killed 26 people, made 160,000 homeless and caused damage  estimated at $25 billion.
Floyd grew unexpectedly into a monster of a storm on Sunday.
``We've been through this enough to know what to anticipate and what to plan for.''
FEMA emergency response centers have been activated in Atlanta and Washington, and it has representatives at state emergency centers from Florida to North Carolina.
Floyd, already a major Category 4 storm with 155 mile an hour sustained winds and gusts of up to 190 miles an hour, would be upgraded to a Category 5 storm if its winds increase to 156 miles an hour.
