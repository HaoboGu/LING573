India's prime minister will  personally flag off the first bus to travel between the Indian and  Pakistan zones of divided Kashmir in almost six decades when the  service resumes next month, an official said Saturday.
The peace process has also led to resumption of trains, buses and flights between India and Pakistan, but the launching of the bus link across Kashmir _ severed in 1948 _ is more resonant, holding out some hope of an end to the intractable conflict over the region, which is claimed by both countries in its entirety.
Indian Kashmir is in the grip of a 15-year-old insurgency that  has so far left thousands dead.
