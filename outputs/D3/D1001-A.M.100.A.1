Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, also Columbine students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs.
His wife nodded: No, they shouldn't have died.
Some cannot forgive Klebold and Harris, and possibly never will.
The tragedy has forced huge issues to an overburdened spotlight: guns, youth violence, school safety, cliques and disaffected youth, community togetherness, peace.
``They wanted death and  destruction.
thousands replied.
``Love is stronger than death.''
