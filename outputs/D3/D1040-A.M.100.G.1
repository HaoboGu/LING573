Blake mentioned that he knew she was doing "her business" from his house and "I was going to take care of that."
Blake, who is free on $1.5 million (euro1.14 million) bail, is charged with one count of murder, two counts of solicitation of murder and a special circumstance of lying in wait.
Blake, 71, faces life in prison if convicted of killing Bakley.
Bakley, 44, was killed May 4, 2001, outside Blake's favorite Italian restaurant in Studio City.
These are the bits and pieces of the strange world of Blake, the former television detective "Baretta," who is accused of murdering his wife and soliciting the stuntmen to participate.
