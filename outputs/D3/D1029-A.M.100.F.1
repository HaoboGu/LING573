A parliamentary committee has been set up to examine the grievances of the tribesmen in Baluchistan _ the biggest and poorest of Pakistan's four provinces _ which was roiled by insurgency in the 1970s.
The tribesmen have set up road blocks and dug trenches along roads into Dera Bugti, a town of about 84,000 people which lies 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of the Baluchistan provincial capital, Quetta, Baluchistan Gov.
It was an alarming escalation of a low-level rebellion in Baluchistan, the country's poorest province, where tribesmen are demanding more returns from the natural gas extracted from their territory and resent the army's moves to set up garrisons in the region.
