"Syria as a government and people announces support to sisterly  Lebanon during those dangerous situations and offers condolences to Mr. Rafik Hariri and other victims' families," Assad was quoted as  saying.
Syria has been under international pressure to withdraw its  troops from Lebanon and not to interfere in Lebanon's internal  affairs.
Hariri, at least five bodyguards and four other people were killed in a massive bombing that blasted his motorcade on a Beirut seafront street earlier Monday.
The procession of mourners, which was larger than expected, included Hariri's three sons, Bahaa, Saadeldine and Ayman, and, in a break with Islamic tradition, hundreds of weeping women.
