Production was suspended and 180 of 216 employees were evacuated after a gas leak appeared at the Snorre A platform in the North Sea on Sunday, giving rise to fears of an explosion.
The Petroleum Safety Directorate was created in January 2004 to oversee safety, health and environmental concerns on Norwegian offshore oil fields.
Its satellite platform Vigdis, whose production transits Snorre,  was also closed.
Norway, which is the world's third-largest oil exporter after  Saudi Arabia and Russia and which normally has an average daily  production of three million barrels, has seen its oil production  reduced by some 205,000 barrels per day (bpd) since the platforms  were closed.
