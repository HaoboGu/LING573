The CEO of Italian train company Trenitalia, Roberto Testore,  said it was "looking with interest to the solar power sector, with a view to producing vehicles on an industrial scale."
"Within the last three months, there has been a huge increase in the number of inquiries and in the number of sales," he said.
Spain has provided a US$54.4 million (euro43.4 million) long-term loan to fund a solar power project for remote villages in the central and southern Philippines, officials said Friday.
"I'm looking into solar energy as a way to be a little more comfortable in the summer," he says.
