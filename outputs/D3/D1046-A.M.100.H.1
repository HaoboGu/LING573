Japan on Tuesday put its army, air force  and navy on standby to provide assistance to survivors of Asia's  tsunami disaster, with most of their work expected to be in  worst-hit Indonesia.
The killer tsunami that was touched off by an 8.7-magnitude  earthquake off Indonesia's Sumatra island on Dec. 26, has climbed  to over 145,000 so far, with over 90,000 deaths reported in  Indonesia.
A second plane with an additional 16 metric tons (18 short tons) of aid was to depart Monday evening.
The aid includes medicines, tents, food, two off-road vehicles, a motor boat, field kitchens, drinking water and helicopter parts.
