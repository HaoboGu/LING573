More than 20 million hectares of forest have been brought under protection and 3.61 million hectares of forest have been planted  since 1997.
The province's efforts have paid off.
The central and provincial governments have invested 160  million yuan (nearly 20 million US dollars) into panda protection  programs since 1992.
Nature preserve workers in  northwest China's Gansu Province have formulated a rescue plan to  save giant pandas from food shortage caused by arrow bamboo  flowering.
The nature preserve, occupying about 220,000 hectares, has 102  giant pandas living wild.
But in Sichuan and in Shaanxi province, which also has panda  reserves, arrow bamboo has also been found blooming.
