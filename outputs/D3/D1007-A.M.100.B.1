While Hong Kong's imports mostly come from Shenzhen, Macao's are mainly from Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Jiangmen cities.
MACAO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Public Health Department of Macao has called on residents to avoid contacting birds, and take proper protective measures if they have to.
They should tell doctors of their contacts with birds.
