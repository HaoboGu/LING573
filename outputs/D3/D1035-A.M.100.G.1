The federal government has paid some benefits to about 6,000   Vietnam veterans who developed cancer and other illnesses.
Their use was stopped in 1971, two years after studies  first linked Agent Orange to birth defects in laboratory animals.

It's virtually impossible to determine which birth defects or ailments are directly related to Agent Orange.
