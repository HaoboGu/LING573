The human form of mad cow disease is called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
Apart from a blanket BSE test on all slaughtered cattle, local authorities in Japan in April began conducting checks on all cows aged 24 months or older that died of natural or unknown causes.
Under EU rules, all cattle for human consumption older than 30 months, all dead-on-farm cattle and emergency slaughtered cattle over 24 months have to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.
Since 1996, public health authorities have warned that people may catch vCJD from eating meat infected with mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or from infected blood transfusions.
