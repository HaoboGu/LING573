A female teacher pleaded guilty Tuesday to having sex with a 14-year-old student, avoiding prison as part of a plea agreement.
Debra Lafave, 25, whose sensational case made tabloid headlines, will serve three years of house arrest and seven years' probation.
She pleaded guilty to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery.
The plea agreement also was designed to resolve similar charges in Marion County, where Lafave was scheduled to appear in court Dec. 8.
It affects their self-esteem.
If convicted at trial in Hillsborough County, Florida, she could have faced up to 15 years in prison on each count.
