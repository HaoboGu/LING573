"It is shameful and deplorable that a state organization was  involved in illegal wiretapping," Roh was quoted as saying.
He is a brother-in-law of  Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee.
A Samsung executive was accused of donating illicit funds to  political parties while dozens of lawmakers, politicians and aides  to Roh were arrested.
The president named Hong, formerly a prominent newspaper publisher, to South Korea's most important diplomatic post in December.
President Roh Moo-hyun ordered an investigation into wiretapping last month after a scandal broke over a recording of an alleged conversation in 1997 between a major newspaper publisher and an influential company executive.
