Malik and Bagri, who have been in custody since their arrest in late 2000, are also charged in connection with a blast on the same day that killed two baggage handlers at Tokyo's Narita Airport.
The woman is in a government witness protection program and a court order bars the publication of her name.
Prosecutors believe Malik and Bagri were part of a conspiracy by British Columbia-based Sikh extremists to take revenge against the Indian government, which owns Air India planes, for attacking a Sikh temple in 1984.
