Former top executives L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz are awaiting retrial in federal court in New York on charges of stealing $600 million (euro483.33 million) from the company.
The judge said there is not enough evidence that Swartz was involved in the tax scheme to join that trial with the larceny retrial.
In the larceny case, Kozlowski and Swartz are accused of looting more than $600 million from Tyco.
Heimer spent much of his presentation arguing that Kozlowski and Swartz had intended to commit a crime.
