Two senior White House aides met here on Saturday with the angry mother of a fallen U.S. soldier, but they rejected Cindy Sheehan's demand for a direct accounting from President Bush for the way he has conducted the war in Iraq.
And I want to tell the president that, and I want to ask the president why my son died,'' Sheehan said, contending that the war was ``based on horrendous lies and deceptions.''
Some have suggested that Sheehan is disloyal to criticize the president in time of war.
