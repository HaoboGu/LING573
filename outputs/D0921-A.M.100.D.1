A judge Thursday agreed to postpone the trial date for a lawsuit brought by Michael Jackson and his former lawyer over the alleged secret recording of them on a charter jet as the singer flew to be booked on child molestation charges.
Steve Cochran took a "temporary leave of absence" from the team defending Jackson from child molestation charges, but will continue to "collaborate" with lead attorney Thomas Mesereau Jr., Jackson said Friday.
