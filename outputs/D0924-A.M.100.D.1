The European Medicines Agency is to review all drugs in the same class as Vioxx after US pharmaceutical giant Merck withdrew the arthritis drug, a spokesman for the agency said Friday.
Merck announced a global withdrawal Thursday of Vioxx, a blockbuster arthritis drug, after a study showed it increased the risk of strokes and heart attacks.
"Both sides will try to spin this in their favor," said Vincent S. Walkowiak, a Dallas lawyer who has worked for Merck in other cases but is not involved in the Vioxx litigation.
