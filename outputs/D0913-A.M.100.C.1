Arguments in the Texas case and a similar one from Kentucky pose the question of whether and how the Ten Commandments can be displayed on government property.
A description in the final displays asserts the exhibits are of "documents that played a significant role in the foundation of our system of law and government."
Opponents of the Kentucky exhibits argue county officials clearly had a religious purpose in posting the Ten Commandments and that the subsequent modifications were little more than a "sham" designed to insulate the displays from scrutiny.
