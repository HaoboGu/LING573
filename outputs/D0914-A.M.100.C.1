In the wake of three explosions that had killed at least 35 people in Egypt's Sinai Desert, Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom on Friday asked his Egyptian counterpart to help rescue Israeli wounded.
Shortly after the hotel blast, a second explosion was heard in the Sinai desert region of Nuaiba, between the Red Sea resorts of Taba and Sharm el-Sheikh, an Egyptian police source said.
