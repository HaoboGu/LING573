The Christian Science Monitor on  Monday named a US journalist kidnapped in Iraq as freelancer Jill  Carroll, who was on assignment for the US-based paper when she was  seized.
Carroll was abducted in western Baghdad on Saturday, by  kidnappers who killed her Iraqi interpreter, the paper said in a  statement, calling for her release.
"The Monitor joins Jill's colleagues -- Iraqi and foreign -- in  the Baghdad press in calling for her immediate and safe release,"  the paper said in a statement which named Carroll for the first  time.
