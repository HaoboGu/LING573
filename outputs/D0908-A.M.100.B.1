The leader of Nepal, King Gyanendra, unexpectedly dissolved the government and claimed absolute power Tuesday, justifying the moves as necessary to restore peace and democracy in the face of a Maoist insurgency that has spread to nearly every corner of the picturesque Himalayan nation.
In a strongly worded statement Tuesday, India's Foreign Ministry condemned Gyanendra's announcement as ``a serious setback to the cause of democracy in Nepal'' and ``a cause of grave concern.''
