In a surprise announcement, Britain's heir to the throne, Prince Charles, declared on Thursday that he will marry his lover, Camilla Parker Bowles, in a spring ceremony at Windsor Castle.
Parker Bowles will never become Queen Camilla, nor will she take over the title of princess of Wales that was bestowed on her predecessor, Diana, whose marriage to Charles ended in divorce, partly over her.
``The duke of Edinburgh and I are very happy that the prince of Wales and Mrs. Parker Bowles are to marry.
