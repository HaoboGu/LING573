Police arrested a man who they said would be charged with homicide in the crash that left train cars mangled and seared.
Key to the legal case, Cooley said, ``is the intent of the individual when he drove onto the tracks.''
Adams said of Alvarez: ``I think his intent at that time was to take his own life, but changed his mind prior to the train actually striking this vehicle.
There was lots of smoke in the car.''
